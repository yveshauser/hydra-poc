Cardano transactions (and blocks) have limits on the transaction size, execution cost, number of inputs and outputs which are dependent on the network parameters and which impact the capabilities of the Head protocol: How many parties can take part in a Head, how many UTxO can be committed to the Head, how many can be fan-out... As the on-chain scripts and transactions mature and are optimised, and the underlying Cardano chain evolves with increased parameters and more efficient scripts execution, those limits will change.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"transaction-cost":{"id":"transaction-cost","title":"Transactions Costs","description":"Sizes and execution budgets for Hydra protocol transactions.
