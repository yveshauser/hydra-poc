Concretely, this means that we need to infer a Head identifier (`HeadId`) from observing each of the Hydra protocol transactions. \\n\\n## Decision\\n\\n* We solve both challenges by defining that ST and PTs **shall use the same** `MintingPolicyScript` and thus have same `CurrencySymbol`\\n* The `MintingPolicyScript` shall be parameterized by `TxOutRef` to yield a unique `CurrencySymbol` per Head\\n(similar to the [`OneShotCurrency`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/1efbb276ef1a10ca6961d0fd32e6141e9798bd11/plutus-use-cases/src/Plutus/Contracts/Currency.hs) example)\\n* ST and one PT per participant are minted in the `initTx`\\n* The `TokenName` of the ST can be any well-known `ByteString`, e.g. `\\"HydraHeadV1\\"`\\n* The `TokenName` of the PTs needs to be the `PubKeyHash` of the respective participant\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\n* Heads can be identified by looking for the `ST` in `init`, `collectCom`, `close`, `contest` or `fanout` transactions, or the `PT` in `commit` transactions. In both cases, the `CurrencySymbol == HeadId`\\n* Our scripts become simpler as we only need to check that ST/PT are paid forward, instead of needing to check datums\\n* The datum produced by `commit` txs (and consumed by `collectCom`) is `Just SerializedTxOut`, which is simpler than also keeping the participant which committed in the datum (compare to full life-cycle of [0.3.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/tree/0.3.0/docs/images/on-chain-full.jpg)).\\n\\n* The `v_head` script validator does not need to be parameterized, which makes discovering new Heads (and also tracking them for metrics) easier as the address to watch for is common to all Heads (of the same `v_head` version).\\n* The `v_head` script (path) for the abort life-cycle can be implemented already much safer by checking that all PTs are burned on the `abort` transaction (counting inputs in abort life-cycle of [0.3.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/tree/0.3.0/docs/images/on-chain-abort.jpg)).\\n* Updated diagrams for the [full](img/on-chain-full.jpg) and [abort](img/on-chain-abort.jpg) on-chain life-cycles of a Hydra Head.\\n\\n## Follow-up questions\\n\\n* What value does the `ST` actually add?

It provides the basis for the main `hydra-node` business logic in `Hydra.Node.processNextEvent` and `Hydra.HeadLogic.update`\\n  [Creation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Node.hs#L256-L257), [Usage](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Node.hs#L174)\\n  2. `SomeOnChainHeadState` is kept in the `Hydra.Chain.Direct` to keep track of the latest known head state, including notable transaction outputs and information how to spend it (e.g. scripts and datums)\\n  [Code](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Chain/Direct.hs#L156-L162), [Usage 1](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Chain/Direct.hs#L449), [Usage 2](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Chain/Direct.hs#L414), [Usage 3](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Chain/Direct.hs#L349-L352)\\n  (There are other unrelated things kept in memory like the event history in the API server or a peer map in the network heartbeat component.)\\n* The interface between the `Hydra.Node` and a `Hydra.Chain` component consists of \\n  - constructing certain Head protocol transactions given a description of it (`PostChainTx tx`):\\n    ```hs\\n    postTx :: MonadThrow m => PostChainTx tx -> m ()\\n    ```\\n  - a callback function when the `Hydra.Chain` component observed a new Head protocol transaction described by `OnChainTx tx`:\\n    ```hs\\n    type ChainCallback tx m = OnChainTx tx -> m ()\\n    ```\\n* Given by the usage sites above, the `Hydra.Chain.Direct` module requires additional info to do both, construct protocol transactions with `postTx` as well as observe potential `OnChainTx` ([here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Chain/Direct.hs#L333-L336)). Hence we see that, operation of the `Hydra.Chain.Direct` component (and likely any implementing the interface fully) is **inherently stateful**.\\n* We are looking at upcoming features to [handle rollbacks](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/issues/185) and dealing with [persisting the head state](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/issues/187).\\n  - Both could benefit from the idea, that the `HeadState` is just a result of pure `Event` processing (a.k.a event sourcing).\\n  - Right now the `HeadState` kept in `Hydra.Node` alone, is not enough to fully describe the state of the `hydra-node`. Hence it would not be enough to just persist all the `Event`s and replaying them to achieve persistence, nor resetting to some previous `HeadState` in the presence of a rollback.\\n\\n## Decision\\n\\n* We define and keep a \\"blackbox\\" `ChainState tx` in the `HeadState tx`\\n  - It shall not be introspectable to the business logic in `HeadLogic`\\n  - It shall contain chain-specific information about the current Hydra Head, which will naturally need to evolve once we have multiple Heads in our feature scope\\n  - For example:\\n  ```hs\\n  data HeadState tx\\n    = IdleState\\n    | InitialState\\n        { chainState :: ChainState tx\\n        -- ...\\n        }\\n    | OpenState\\n        { chainState :: ChainState tx\\n        -- ...\\n        }\\n    | ClosedState\\n        { chainState :: ChainState tx\\n        -- ...\\n        }\\n  ```\\n* We provide the latest `ChainState tx` to `postTx`:\\n  ```hs\\n  postTx :: ChainState tx -> PostChainTx tx -> m ()\\n  ```\\n* We change the callback interface of `Chain` to\\n  ```hs\\n  type ChainCallback tx m = (ChainState tx -> Maybe (OnChainTx tx, ChainState tx)) -> m ()\\n  ```\\nwith the meaning, that invoking the callback indicates receival of a potential Hydra transaction which is `Maybe` observing a relevant `OnChainTx tx` paired with a (potentially updated) `ChainState tx`.\\n* We also decide to extend `OnChainEvent` and `OnChainEffect` with a `ChainState tx` and threading it through the `Hydra.HeadLogic`.\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\n* We need to change the construction of `Chain` handles and the call sites of `postTx`\\n* We need to extract the state handling (similar to the event queue) out of the `HydraNode` handle and shuffle the main of `hydra-node` a bit to be able to provide the latest `ChainState` to the chain callback as a continuation.\\n* We need to make the `ChainState` already serializable (`ToJSON`, `FromJSON`) as it will be part of the `HeadState`.\\n* We can drop the `TVar` of keeping `OnChainHeadState` in the `Hydra.Chain.Direct` module.\\n* We might be able to simplify the `ChainState tx` to be just a `UTxOType tx` later.\\n\\n## Alternative\\n\\n* We could extend `PostChainTx` and `OnChainTx` with `ChainState` and keep the signatures:\\n```hs\\npostTx :: MonadThrow m => PostChainTx tx -> m ()\\ntype ChainCallback tx m = (ChainState tx -> Maybe (OnChainTx tx) -> m ()\\n```\\n* Consequences:\\n  - We need to change the interface between `Hydra.Chain.Direct.Tx` and `Hydra.Chain.Direct.State` to something else than `OnChainTx` as the former would not have a suitable `ChainState` to construct, e.g. `observeInitTx` would return `Maybe InitObervation`. This may be an orthogonally desired change though.\\n  - Traces (e.g. `ToPost`) and errors (e.g. `PostTxError`) would automatically include the full `ChainState`, which might be helpful but also possible big."}]}')}}]);
